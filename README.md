## Conservative Sparsification for Visual Inertial Navigation System (CS-VINS)

CS-VINS is a sparisification-based system which is an extension to VINS; This system is motivated by preserving sparse and nonlinear information after marginalization and simplifying VIO scheme rather than perserving linearied prior that ordinary fixed-lag smoother shares;
