## Conservative Sparsification for Visual Inertial Navigation System (CS-VINS)

CS-VINS is a sparisification-based system which is an extension to [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono); This system is motivated by preserving sparse and nonlinear information after marginalization and simplifying VIO scheme rather than preserving linearied prior that ordinary fixed-lag smoother shares;This code supports ***Linux without ROS***, it is possible to run on **Mac OS X** or **Windows** with sightly change.Please cite us if you use our code.
